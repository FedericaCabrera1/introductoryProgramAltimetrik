Semantic HTML
It is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (how it looks). Since the 1990s when Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view of separating content and presentation. 

Good semantic HTML improves the accessibility of web documents. In order to achieve this, the majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance and larger documents sizes.  

Accessibility 
Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. 
For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user´s time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.
However, although we traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

Building accessible sites benefit everyone:

Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
It is also the law in some places

How to implement accessibility into your project:

If accessibility is considered from the start of the project, the cost of making most content accessible should be minimal. 
Accessibility should be added into the testing regime, just like testing for any other important target audience segment. Test early and often

WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite)
It defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. 

It provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction.

WAI-ARIA provides Web authors with:
Roles to describe the type of widget presented, such as “menu”, “treeitem”, “slider”, and “progressbar”
Roles to describe the structure of the Web page, such as headings, regions, and tables (grids)
Properties to describe the state widgets are in, such as “checked” for a check box, or “haspopup” for a menu.
Properties to define live regions of a page that are likely to get updates (such as stock quotes), as well as an interruption policy for those updates—for example, critical updates may be presented in an alert dialog box, and incidental updates occur within the page
A way to provide keyboard navigation for the Web objects and events.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
The process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business. The better visibility the more likely you are going to call attention and attract potential customers. 

How does SEO work? 
Search engines such as Google, Bing or Yahoo collect information about every site and put them in an index (like a library with every web page), next, algorithms analyze pages in the index (taking into account hundreds of ranking factors) to determine the order pages should appear in the search results, to provide the user with exactly the one that will have an answer to his questions. 

Ways to improve your site's Ranking SEO:
Metadata: review and update metadata as your site changes over time.

Title metadata; responsible for the title displayed at the top of a browser window and as the headline for search engines results. 
Description metadata; the textual description that a browser may use in your page search return, should be a concise and appealing description with the goal of encouraging people to enter. 
Keyword metadata: rarely used for engine ranking, however, as you already know your keywords phrases, they should be added into your keyword metadata (try to keep it 3-7 phrases, each one consisting of 1-4 words).

Alt tags:
Always describe your visual media using alt tags or alternative text descriptions. This will allow search engines to locate the page 
DOM (Document Object Model)

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, that is constructed as a tree of objects:
It is a platform interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of a document.
